üé¨ BookMyShow Clone ‚Äì Movie Ticket Booking System
üìå Overview

This project is a BookMyShow-inspired movie ticket booking system, built with Spring Boot (backend) and React.js (frontend). It allows users to browse movies, view show timings, check seat availability, and make bookings.

The goal was to simulate a real-world full-stack application with proper REST APIs, database relations, and a clean frontend integration.

üöÄ Features

User registration & login

Browse movies by genre/language

View shows & timings

Seat selection with availability status

Ticket booking with payment options

Backend validations (seat availability, duplicate booking prevention)

REST APIs with proper request/response DTOs

MySQL integration with foreign key relationships

üìñ What I Learned

During this project, I gained hands-on knowledge in:

Designing REST APIs in Spring Boot

Implementing DTOs & validation for clean API communication

Handling foreign key relationships in SQL (Users ‚Üî Bookings ‚Üî Shows ‚Üî Seats)

React basics: routing, forms, API integration, error handling

Importance of backend validation (e.g., seat availability checks before booking)

How frontend and backend communicate using JSON

üêû Errors I Faced & Fixes

Ambiguous handler methods in Spring Boot

Error: "Ambiguous handler methods mapped..."

Fix: Used @GetMapping("/id/{id}"), @GetMapping("/genre/{genre}") instead of overlapping mappings.

Seat availability error during booking

Error: "Seat D2 is not available" even for free seats.

Fix: Corrected database status values (AVAILABLE, BOOKED) and updated booking logic.

React component import issue

Error: "Element type is invalid..."

Fix: Ensured proper default vs named exports/imports.

Foreign key constraint errors in MySQL

Cause: Inserting data without respecting foreign key relations.

Fix: Inserted movies ‚Üí shows ‚Üí seats ‚Üí bookings in proper order.

CORS issue between React & Spring Boot

Error: Blocked requests due to CORS policy.

Fix: Used @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000") in controllers.

üßë‚Äçüíª Hands-On Exposure

This project gave me practical exposure to:

Full-stack development (React + Spring Boot)

Database schema design & entity relationships

Implementing seat booking logic in a real-world scenario

Handling API errors gracefully in frontend

Debugging & fixing runtime exceptions in both frontend & backend

Structuring a project like a production-grade system

‚úÖ Future Improvements

Add authentication (JWT-based login/signup)

Implement payment gateway integration

Admin dashboard for managing movies & shows

Deploy project on AWS / Docker

üîπ This project not only helped me improve technical skills but also gave me confidence in end-to-end application development, debugging, and deploying a production-ready system.
